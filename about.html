        <h1>Welcome to CCCStudio website</h1>
        <p class="par">
            I'm just a little Minecraft devloppeur with MCreator who loves computer technology, 
            video games and programming (a nerd, that is, or a geek). Actually, I'm a French speaker, 
            so this site is partially translated with Deepl, so it may have some mistakes 
            (including in this text). If you like what I do, feel free to stay as you are! 
            (You can also download, share, all that, but you've got the time.)
